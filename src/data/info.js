            "I graduated from UW with a degree in Environmental Studies. After graduation I started a job as an Office Coordinator/ Legal Assistant at a wealth management firm in downtown Seattle. In this position I was in charge of solving any problem that was affecting the office, and these issues often ended up being technical in nature. Loving the challenge that tech provided me, and wanting to find ways to further improve the client interfaces that I was working with, I decided to enroll myself in UW's full stack coding bootcamp. The bootcamp was one of the most challenging things I ever did. I look forward to continuing to push myself as I continue to explore this ever expanding field.",
